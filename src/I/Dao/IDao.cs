    ///     Data Access Object. This interface is mainly used for documentation purposes, to flag a type as a
    ///     DAO. In projects, interfaces should be defined that
    ///     extend this interface, with methods that have a technology independent contract that describes
    ///     interaction with persistent storage. The actual implementation of these DAO methods will depend on
    ///     the persistence technology used: different classes that implement the DAO interface will produce
    ///     the desired result in different technologies. Those classes can extend a technology specific superclass
    ///     that offers support for that technology (e.g., JDBC, Hibernate, JDO, EJB, RMI, JPA, ...).
    ///     DAO implementations are almost always have a state, because of the underlying persistence technology. Even
    ///     then, the public API specified in the interface can be stateless.
    ///     Implementations should be JavaBeans, with a default constructor. Further dependencies should be filled
    ///     out using setters, and DAO methods should be allowed to consider it a programming error if the
    ///     dependencies are not fulfilled when the DAO method is called. What the exact dependencies are that need
    ///     to be fulfilled for a particular DAO implementation is technology dependent, and this cannot be
    ///     generalized. Therefor, each DAO features a general method {@link #isOperational()}, which is used as a
    ///     precondition for most functional methods of the DAO. If those methods are called without the DAO being
    ///     ready (and it is made ready outside of the control of the immediate user often, using IoC), they should
    ///     throw a programming error according to the ppwcode exception vernacular.
    ///     Subtypes may depend on the fact that the objects in persistent storage are
    ///     {@link PersistentBean PersistentBeans}, although this will not always be necessary.
    ///     A Dao cannot be made {@link java.io.Serializable} (we tried). Hibernate dao's probably keep a reference
    ///     to a Hibernate Session, and, although Hibernate Sessions are {@link java.io.Serializable}, they cannot be
    ///     serialized while they are connected. So, we state as part of the contract that Dao's are not
    ///     {@link java.io.Serializable). Note that this poses a particular problem when Dao's are used in
    ///     web applications, where all objects in sessions scope must {@link java.io.Serializable}.
